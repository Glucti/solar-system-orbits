# Solar system simulation is JS using React

Kind of low accuracy, made using Keplerian formulae found here https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/approx_pos.html

Work in progress. 
TODO: 
 add the perihelion and aphelion points to the orbit
 make the planets actually look cool
 stop the user from zooming out all the way
 add moons orbiting planets 0-0
 add some actual simulated launches
